# Data Analyis example(s) from my research at the Thermal Protection and Comfort Center (TPACC)
# 
### [Example 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adamcwatts/TPACC/blob/master/Data_Analysis.ipynb): Measuring and Analyzing the thermal performance properties of three fabric types.
  The three fabrics were a D200 fabric, a D200 material with the
  thermal liner material positioned beneath it, and a coated PVC material with each fabric cut to the exact dimension of the
  hot plate.Each sample was allowed to reach a steady state with the hot plate prior to the dry ice block
  being placed on top. 
  
  Dry ice was placed on top of the fabric for 5 seconds before being taken off and returned to a
  designated cooler. Experiments were terminated when the fabric and hot plate returned to steady state or close to.
